# Next.js API Route Delay Client-Side Error
This example demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where a delay in an API route can lead to errors on the client-side if not handled properly. The client-side data fetching mechanism assumes immediate responsiveness from the API and may throw errors if the response takes longer than anticipated.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error handling in the client-side data fetching and potentially adjusting the timeout settings.
